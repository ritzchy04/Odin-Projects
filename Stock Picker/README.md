Stock Picker

Description:
#stockpicker method takes an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day (index), and returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. 

What I've learned:
The use of array#combination, a combination of elements, e.g. [0,1,2], is [0,1], [0,2], [1,2]; #max_by enumerables which returns the object in enum that gives max value from the given block, and a review of Array#map which returns a new Array whose elements are the return values from the block, if given.
